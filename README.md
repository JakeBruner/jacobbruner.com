I really dont know what I'm doing. I'm building this website with primarily Sveltekit, Typescript, Tailwindcss, and Vercel. With a notable shoutout to Mdsvex for providing markdown parsing within my sveltekit endpoints.

After spending dozens of hours on this, I would maybe advise against choosing the most bleeding-edge tech stack possible, since too much of my type has been spent resolving breaking changes in my dependencies.

Either way, if you read my code, it's probably not amazing. Againâ€”I don't know what I'm doing and I've never taken a coding class in my life.
