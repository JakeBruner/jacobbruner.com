This portfolio website is built primarily with svelte/sveltekit and typescript, although some rust, bash, glsl, and python is littered throughout for various animations, interactive endpoints, etc. 

I would highly reccomend svelte for anyone willing to take a stab at a pretty young framework. Support for libraries and common practices can take some getting used to, since there's often a "svelte" way to do things. I actually think, now that I'm quite familiar with React and NextJS, that sveltekit is a good way to introduce someone to the tsx, component-based frame of mind, since svelte makes it quicker to *make* components and functionality, whereas I might prefer React/TSX for making more *reliable/solid* components. Especially for something like a portfolio site, svelte is amazing to just design without worrying about whether a refactored component should be memoized or if a useEffect call could be optimized. Perhaps, what I want to try for my next project in the future is Solid, which might be the best of both worlds in terms of performance out-of-the-box and the more-explicit syntax and behavior I like about React.

Either way, if you read my code, it's probably not amazing. I've really never taken a coding class in my life.
