In this project for the IB Music HL I 'Contemporary Music Maker Project,' I collaborated with my friend to compose an original composition for solo piano to accompany one of her films. In this project, I learned a lot about the job of a film composer, especially with respect to composing in a manner that fits the style or tone of a film.
