I wrote this song originally in 2019. All in all, it took only a couple days to write and produce. The harmony is fairly simple, especially with the second part mimicking Toby Fox's "It's Raining Somewhere else." For some reason, this song got on one of Spotify's curated playlists for ambient music and achieved a number of streams in a very short period of time.
