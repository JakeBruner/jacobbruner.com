This piece, "Zenith", is the culmination of well over a hundred hours of work, started well over a year ago. The hardest part was trying to lend more form and structure into many of the interesting ideas I had. Overall, I found what I expected... orchestral writing is hard. Trying to maintain a delicate balance between individual voice leading (horizontal movement) and harmony (vertical movement) is a tough task. I could definitely sit and tweak parts of this thing for another fifty hours if I had the time. I'm proud of where it's at, though.

A notable shout-out goes to Rimsky-Korsakov's "Principles of Orchestration" for being the primary reference of my study (for the most part). Any parts where the timbre of the insturment's is weird or out of place likely was written before I began reading this classic, and I would appreciate it if you could point it out to me. Like, I know I tended to use the lower register of the winds far too often where they would be far overpowered by the horns and strings in a real orchestra. This stuff is tricker than one might think!
