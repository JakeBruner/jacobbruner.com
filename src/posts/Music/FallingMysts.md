"The Falling Mysts" has been one of my favorite songs for years, after first hearing it in the context of Geometry Dash and the extreme demon Athanatos. Despite the original song's early-2000s reminiscent EDM sound, Dimrain47's harmony and active melodies have always stuck out to me as highly innovative and complex. For this reason, I sought to arrange the first two minutes for a small orchestral ensemble to really let this song's musical qualities shine. The samples sound amazing following the update to Musescore 4 and the Muse Sounds libraries, culminating in this end result that really lets the arrangement shine. I would note, though, that I am not a professional arranger, and there may likely be mistakes in registers, playability, or transitions that I'm not aware of as a pianist. Notwithstanding this disclaimer, I've put a lot of effort into trying to make this reasonably playable for each instrument, however certain parts, like the double stops, may need tweaking if this is played by a real-life ensemble.

I hope you enjoy it!
