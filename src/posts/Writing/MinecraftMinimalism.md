Minecraft is widely regarded as one of the most influential and impactful games of the 21st century. Although countless aspects of Minecraft deserve praise, one thing in particular has exceedingly piqued my interest. As a long-time veteran of competitive (Skywars masters division), modded and casual Minecraft since update 1.4.2 in late 2012, Minecraft has always occupied a special place in my childhood in an almost indescribable way. But as my interest in the game has been rekindled with the new 1.18 ‘Caves and Cliffs’ update, I am getting a glimpse into the fundamental way in which Minecraft evokes powerful emotion: minimalism. 

Upon updating my game client, I loaded into a randomly generated, never-seen-before world. I promptly made my mark in the pristine nature by collecting wood and designing a house. In a plains biome, I carved out the side of a mountain to create a lake-side log cabin. My only mark on this infinite world was this small settlement, fitted with a bed, chest, and a furnace, which paled in comparison to the vast mountains, rivers, caves, and plains around me. The thing that distinguishes Minecraft from the majority of videogames is the sheer vastness of the world, and the, in some sense, loneliness of the survival experience. In most games, saying “the possibilities are endless” is somewhat hyperbolic, in that games across all genres typically have a set of rules for how the player interacts with the world and progresses through the game. I find, although anecdotally, that when non-gamers try a game for the first time, they might become frustrated with the limited and unintuitive ways to accomplish a task, especially since most games rely on many unspoken conventions (e.g., red corresponds to health, Non-player-characters often provide instructions etc.). Without exaggeration, the world of Minecraft is ‘endless,’ and while there is an established itinerary of normal things to do (e.g., build a house, mine for resources) at the end of the day I cannot shake some sense of loneliness and solitude while playing in my newly created world. Save company from a few tamed wolves or trades with some villagers, anyone who has enjoyed Minecraft can relate to the feeling of aimlessly sprinting across endless biomes, discovering new terrain, and forming their mark on the world. In this way, the world of Minecraft has an incredible aura of solitude. Despite the number of times I have killed the Ender Dragon, despite the hours I have logged strip-mining for diamonds, or despite the number of times I have clicked furiously to win a combat duel… I can still easily waste away any amount of time disassociated from the real world and fully immersed in my survival world. And within the vast nothingness, the blank canvas, I find that Minecraft’s ability to be so nostalgic speaks wonders to the value of minimalism in creating emotion. Specifically, the nature of a vast world provides that the player has to make value of what is, as opposed to what isn’t. The survival experience forces the player to appreciate how little they have, be it their unimpressive wooden house or their quaint crop farm. This speaks to the fundamental human condition and the ability for humans to find a silver lining in even the most bereft of conditions. In this way, Minecraft also provides a reprieve from the hardships of the real world.

For myself and many others my age, playing Minecraft draws on nostalgic memories of a stress-free childhood and careless youth. Especially as life’s untimely onset of responsibilities like college and future responsibilities pile on stress, Minecraft provides a way to momentarily let go. For a few hours when I have free time, I can escape to my world of leading two baby sheep to my animal farm (pictured below), as opposed to the real-life and future-implicating task of completing homework or writing an essay. I cannot overstate the value that Minecraft provides in allowing an escape from the harsh realities of life. Through its minimalism, one can truly escape the chronic stresses of our maximalist society. Instead of deriving enjoyment from vapid consumerism like ordering fast fashion off Amazon or death scrolling on social media, Minecraft’s vastness and minimalism teaches the player to enjoy the small, seemingly insignificant things. In the real world, where at times it seems you are but a cog in a machine, Minecraft occupies a reality in which there exists just one bed, one wooden house, one wheat farm. Instead of a world where everyone’s phones, hairstyles, apartments, or homework answers look the same, Minecraft really is a personal experience, where despite some commonality, no two survival worlds look the same. I know that at times, I feel like our modern, technological world is founded upon so many layers of abstraction—to the point where anything I do has already been accomplished innumerable times. By contrast, Minecraft serves as a tangible existence wherein things have yet to be accomplished. I believe that despite the bad reputation of video games, Minecraft fills a similar purpose as going to the gym, drawing a painting, or reading a book; it exists as a way to escape one’s present situation. But I don’t believe Minecraft’s game design alone contributes to its uniqueness; the symbolism of it’s artistic components takes this ‘feeling’ to a new level.

A few days ago I was tending to my sheep farm when I heard four notes of a new addition to the Minecraft soundtrack and was instantly transported to a warm, inviting other-worldly atmosphere. Twenty seconds into Kumi Tanioka’s Floating Dream, four sustained piano notes outline a Gmaj9 chord beneath a soft synth pad. Tactfully voiced in wide intervals, the piano sits on this unique sound for long enough for the piano to fade to nothing. This gorgeous opening phrase (reminiscent of the openings of Spirited Away’s One Summer’s Day, Ocarina of Time’s title theme, and the like) descends into an inventive series of tonicizations or recontextualizations. This song says so much with so little, relying on expressive silence and clever voicing to evoke such strong emotion. With just a few notes, Tanioka accomplishes an expansive landscape of feeling. Instead of the simplicity detracting from the weight of the song, I argue that its minimalism contributes to the emotion, almost begging the listener to employ creativity to fill the silent gaps. This certain tone is pervasive throughout every composition in Minecraft’s soundtrack, even to the extent that Minecraft music occupies its own unique genre of sound, instantly recognizable by anyone familiar with the game. One interesting musical device that provides a glimpse into Minecraft’s harmony is the major seventh chord. This harmonic device creates a unique tone because it encompasses both a major and minor chord wrapped in a bow with the slightly dissonant major seventh interval. While major might loosely express happiness and minor might loosely express sadness, the major seventh expresses a more complex emotion: melancholy. In one of Minecraft’s most well-known tracks, Wet Hands, the slow piano alternates between two major seventh chords (the I and the IV chord) to instill a deep sense of ‘home,’ nostalgia, and yearning. In this way, the soundtrack develops more complex emotion and nets a greater emotional impact on the listener. In addition, Minecraft music employs a narrative throughout each piece. The individual songs embody one large crescendo and diminuendo, where the music slowly grows from nothing—a few piano notes—into a thick, textured soundscape, until gradually falling back into the silence of the Minecraft world. I first recognized this pattern in Lena Raine’s Left to Bloom (one of my favorite composers whom I only recently learned wrote music for Minecraft?!). Within this song, Raine gradually adds texture to a repeating and recontextualizing ostinato figure. It begins with soft, barely-audible tones until crescendoing to a full expanse of sound. And through this dramatic musical development, Raine employs the listener to resonate with the music for a brief few minutes, until she leaves you with complete silence. By emphasizing the up to twenty minutes between soundtracks playing, the player is forced to appreciate the soft ambient sound effects of the world. Unlike most games where a soundtrack is constantly looping, this silence causes a deeper extent of engagement. Overall, I believe the soundtrack highly contributes to making Minecraft a minimalist masterpiece that creates an emotion-specific to the mindless wandering across the vast world.

An often overlooked component of Minecraft’s artistic merit is the creativity of the paintings within the game. Created by Swedish surrealist Kristoffer Zetterstrand, Minecraft’s artwork is an intriguing symbol of the interplay between the digital and real worlds. The works of art have become iconic symbols of the game itself, but few players know the backstory beyond seemingly insignificant pixel art. Zetterstrand’s work combines classical-like conventions of oil painting with computerized imagery to create a unique kind of collage. In the game, there exist twenty–six pixelated paintings, ranging from humorous to completely incomprehensible. However, few know that each one corresponds to a real-life oil painting that had been edited and pixelated to be put into the game. Taking this unique symbolism and further reducing his paintings to the pixelated world of Minecraft adds another dimension of this blurred line between real and digital. A lot of Zetterstrand’s work draws on his experience playing video games. For instance, he stated that after dying in the original Counter-Strike game, he entered the spectator mode wherein he enjoyed clipping through the level geometry and viewing the world from a ghostly perspective. This liminal/transitory space as a spectator entity served as inspiration for one of his early paintings: this spectator perspective in the Counter-Strike map de_dust. His later paintings pattern this surreal style, combining elements of computerized rendering and highly realistic oil painting. Putting his already-symbol-laden works into a digital game, especially one as unique as Minecraft, truly adds another layer of meaning to his work. For instance, the painting “pointer” is a play-on Michelangelo’s “The Creation of Man” that was digitized into the game. Through this transformation from a digital-like oil painting to a pixelated Minecraft painting, Minecraft further emphasizes the transitory threshold between reality and the digital world. I believe in this way, the inclusion of Zetterstrand’s art either intentionally or unintentionally reinforces Minecraft’s eccentricity within gaming. Whereas most games attempt to embody an entirely-different, artificial reality, Minecraft—a minimal, sometimes boring affair blurring the line of a videogame—achieves long-lasting, real emotion.

Minecraft is an experience, a journey, an emotion. As a defining element of my childhood, it represents much more than just a to-do list of tasks to beat the game; it represents a medium through which the player can manipulate reality. But the game doesn’t achieve this through endless complexity or an expanse of content, Minecraft achieves this through minimalism. By providing the context and the tools for the player to create their own meaning within the infinite world, Minecraft allows the player to create their own values. For these reasons, I believe that Minecraft’s recent surge in popularity is no coincidence. In a reality in which people are increasingly stressed, disenfranchised, and disheartened with the present reality, Minecraft offers an invaluable reprieve. The phenomenon of Minecraft’s popularity draws on people’s fundamental goal of creating meaning for themselves and demonstrates how materialism is not always the path to happiness.
