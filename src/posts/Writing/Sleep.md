Seventy-three percent of adolescents are not getting adequate sleep at night. But this surprises no one, right? Teens just lack the time-management and decision-making skills to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, right? It must be their addiction to phones, video games, and social media, right? The solution must be to educate kids about the importance of sleep and count on them to make good decisions… right?

Most teens know that sleep is important—countless PSA videos, school-wide announcements, sleep education campaigns, and lectures from teachers have instilled that message and cast responsibility to the individual to improve their habits. But despite the extent of awareness about this issue, adolescents are increasingly spoiling their bodies’ pivotal years of development because of lost sleep. Examining why this increased emphasis on sleep education has categorically failed its goal of improving sleep provokes the consideration that our societal perception of sleep may be fundamentally flawed.

As with many issues, people prefer to pass the blame to the individual, as opposed to the environmental factors that contributed to their present situation. It is an interesting philosophical question: why is this fallacy so prevalent when discussing multivariate issues? Some argue it results from malicious intent, whereas it could possibly arise as the default lens–of–least–friction through which to approach an issue. Either way, modern society—amplified by its culture of ‘meritocracy’—is partial to deeming sleep-deprived individuals unmotivated, lazy, irresponsible, and poor time-managers. Yet, increasing consensus in scientific literature highlights that individuals have less agency over their sleep habits than they would like to believe.

A ‘chronotype’ is a term used to describe the individual deviations in our circadian rhythms (a.k.a., when our body wants to fall asleep and wake up). Simplified in the context of sleep, it represents a propensity for an individual to go to bed at a specific time in a 24-hour period. Formality aside, we often encapsulate this idea with idioms like ‘early bird’ or ‘night owl.’ Over significant enough time periods, these chronotypes are constant. This makes sense, if you were to ask a person who falls into the extremes of these categories, they would often tell you they’ve been a ‘night-owl’ for most of their life. However, this notion directly contradicts the way we approach sleep education and improving sleep quality, right? Corroborating this fundamental misunderstanding, experts have demonstrated that ‘gene-environment’ factors play a staple role in determining chronotype. For instance, external components, a.k.a., zeitgebers,—e.g., light, meal times, social behavior, and work/school schedules (the traditional model of discussing sleep)—play an equivalent role compared to genetic variations. There are at least 22 known genetic variations that have been linked to circadian rhythm regulation dubbed ‘clock genes.’ With these genetic variations, most adults fall into a normal distribution of chronotypes (see graph), and although the majority of people have a middle chronotype, extremes at both ends face difficulty adapting to societal schedules. Among adults, about 35% of people fail to get adequate sleep (defined as less than seven hours). These sleep-deprived individuals—instead of simply falling a standard deviation from the mean—highly correspond to later chronotypes because of a societal emphasis on early morning productivity and 9–5 working hours.

Another keystone contributor to chronotypical variation is age. By solely biological mechanisms, children, as well as the elderly, are likely to have an early chronotype, whereas, in adolescence, chronotypes shift forward multiple hours. For instance, the average chronotype for a high school student is the propensity to sleep from 1:00 am to 9:00 am. This change—mediated through a shift in circadian rhythms corresponding to delated melatonin and cortisol hormone timing—is hardcoded into the developmental stages of puberty. Hence an important, often overlooked factor is the role that school start times play in inhibiting quality sleep.

The average school start time across the United States is 8:00 am. This means that, for the average student, school starts a whole hour earlier than the adolescent body is prepared to wake up. These hours of lost sleep have a myriad of effects, since, contrary to common belief, sleep loss is cumulative. For example, reducing sleep by one hour/night for one week impairs cognitive performance to a similar extent as one night of total sleep deprivation. In both positive and negative ways, sleep maintains a close relationship with academic ability. Studies showed that—transcending academic ability—Students who received eight hours of sleep in the five days before a final exam significantly outperformed (adjusted based on their prior grade in the class) their sleep-deprived peers (p = .002). Though to students’ detriment, sleep loss limits the brain’s ability to sustain focus and consolidate memories and directly correlates to lower academic performance. But for developing teens, the long-term consequences on the brain and body vastly outweigh short-term symptoms of sleep deprivation. During these formative years, the brain matures in a serial way from back to front. Teenagers have largely mastered their ability to move and speak (areas like the cerebellum occipital lobe, parietal lobe), yet notoriously lack critical thinking and judgment (prefrontal cortex). The basis for these flaws is the fact that the prefrontal cortex is not fully developed within teenagers. By restricting time asleep, teens miss out on the slow-wave, restorative phases of rest wherein the brain secretes growth hormone (somatotropin) and reinforces learning. Sleep experts credit this portion of sleep as pivotal in the growth and development of the brain and hence the prefrontal cortex in teens. Once a certain biological age is met – usually around 25 years –, brain development ceases and individuals who experienced chronic sleep deprivation may present as cognitively and physically less developed than their peers. Furthermore, late chronotypes of all ages are more likely to face mental illness, abuse cigarettes, and consume alcohol (see graphs). While difficult to establish causality with statistics alone, a slew of data points hint at a propensity for late chronotypes to face substance use and mental health disorders: inferred as a result of either developmental issues or maladaptive coping to exclusive work/school schedules.

The solution to this pertinent issue should no longer be to blame the individual. Forgoing a pessimistic resignation to ‘it’s society’s fault,’ this issue is comparatively simple (≠ easy) to address. For teenagers, the primary variable affecting their quality of sleep is school start times. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that “Although a number of factors, including biological changes in sleep associated with puberty, lifestyle choices, and academic demands, negatively affect middle and high school student’s ability to obtain sufficient sleep, the evidence strongly implicates earlier school start times (i.e., before 8:30 am) as a key modifiable contributor to insufficient sleep.” Delayed school start times is associated with an improvement on countless metrics; for instance, increased sleep duration, improved attendance, better grades, higher graduation rates, lower rates of depression, and fewer motor vehicle crashes. Within society, the problem of sleep loss is worsened by the way we value morning productivity and dignify working extreme hours. Often, phrases like “rich people do not sleep,” “I function fine on 4-5 hours of sleep,” or “early bird gets the worm” create a negative bias towards night-productivity which can corrosively manifest as internalized insecurity about one’s value as a person. For some, the inability to wake up at 6am for an 8am job is a fact of their biology, not some intrinsic lack of motivation or an indicator of a drive to succeed. Since sleep is predicated on environmental and biological processes, not individual motivation, we should all strive to innovate methods of adapting our work/school schedules to our sleep habits, not the other way around.
