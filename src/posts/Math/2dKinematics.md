In this project, (completed while learning basic calculus) I taught myself the ideas of parametric functions and vectors as a way to represent quantities changing with respect to a certain parameterization (here, time). Although it seems pretty basic looking back, this was quite an eye opening project because I had to grasp these concepts very fundamentally to be able to animate them visually. This combined with other difficulties such as making the displayed computed values react nicely with a change in the boundary conditions. This actually happens to be great practice for webdev, where making things respond nicely to different screen sizes is a big hassle. Either way, this was my first real foray into animation. If you haven't already checked it out, Desmos is a _fantastic_ tool for playing around with math. It can even do arbirary statistical regressions on data, do numerical calculus, and much more (especially if you learn how to write javascript for it).
