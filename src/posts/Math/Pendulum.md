In this paper, I sought to model the behavior of a pendulum given a few simplifying assumptions. I first derived the full, unapproximated differential equation for a pendulum's motion, then made the simplifying 'small angle' assumption and solved the problem statement. In doing so, I also calculated the percentage error introduced, as well as the limitations of this model. This assignment was originally for my 10th grade Advanced Algebra and Calculus Honors class.
