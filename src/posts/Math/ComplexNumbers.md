All in one day, I decided I was going to make and produce an entire video about the uniqueness of complex numbers. It was the exact due date of MoMath's "Steven Strogatz Math Communication Competition", which had been on the back of my mind for a while. Complex numbers, in specific, are a topic that is needlessly confusing when introduced to Algebra II students. In many ways, it seems entirely arbitrary and, for lack of a better term, made-up, when this is farthest from the case. In the video, I detail a number of unique properties of complex numbers that make them stand out in their broad applicability. I discuss the plethora of properties that make them, I argue, the most strucutre-rich algebraic construction---even moreso than the reals (which they will happily algebraiclly close). Complex numbers are one of my favorite aspects of Math and are the first glimpse into the world of abstract algebra.
