The primary goal of this paper was to attempt to learn how to use LaTeX, the industry-standard typesetter for Math papers. The content goes in-depth deriving the differential equation of Newton's Law of Cooling from first principles and using it to solve a real world problem. The data was collected in-person for my 10th grade Advanced Algebra and Calculus Honors class.
