In this paper, I explored Ascombe's Quartet: a dataset that is used to illustrate the importance of visualizing data before performing statistical analysis. The dataset consists of four sets of data that have the same mean, variance, and linear regression line, but are very different when visualized. This paper was completed for IB Mathematics Approaches and Analysis HL as a practice for the Internal Assessment (with a predetermined prompt).
