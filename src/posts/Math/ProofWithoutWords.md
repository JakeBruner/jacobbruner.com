This paper was a short assignment for IB Maths Higher Level Approaches and Analysis class. Duing our unit on proof, we were tasked to explain a visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem as well as another of our choosing. I chose a visual proof of integration by parts, which gave me insight into how paramaterization can demonstrate a sort of 'inverse product rule,' leveraging visual quantities like 'area under a curve' to prove a more general result about integration.
