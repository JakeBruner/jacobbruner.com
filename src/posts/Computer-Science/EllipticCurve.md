In this recent project, I rewrote a script from 11th grade that generates the Cayley table (that is, a special multiplication table for groups) for an elliptic curve. Although it was originally written in javascript to be ran with Nodejs, I underwent the task of porting it to typescript---a language I had little familiarity with until now. Although this project was tedious at times, I do feel like I came out with strong intuition for Elliptic Curve groups. In the future, I hope to add more tooling and features that can provide more information about a given elliptic curve and it's structure.
