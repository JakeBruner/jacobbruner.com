Over the past summer (2022), I was paid to work alongside an awesome crew of engineers at the Wyoming-based "Square One Robotics." Most notable was my work with a couple individuals on a DoD contract to delayer silicon microchips for reverse-engineering purposes. It overall was a phenomenal experienece.

One of the coolest projects I did was put together a timelapse of each image after a delayering cycle. What you're seeing in this video is only a few dozen nanometers of silicon being shaved away at a time!
