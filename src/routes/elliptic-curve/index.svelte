    Elliptic curves are a special type of algebraic curve that have a well-defined group structure
    on them by drawing secants through points. Over a finite field, however, they posess different
    properties that make them suitable for use in cryptography. To attempt to understand their group
    struture, I've built a program that calculates the numeber of points on the curve and generates
    the cayley table.
